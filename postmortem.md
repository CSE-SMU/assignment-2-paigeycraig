# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
Wasn't too bad, I had to do a lot of research on my own. It took a while to go through and really understand everything.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
Yeah, I learned how to draw all of this. I had never worked so in depth with css files before


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
Yes, I used them all.



## How could this assignment be improved? 
The only way that this could maybe be improved is if we had maybe done a less involved face, just for the sake of getting overwhelmed with all the different aspects of the face. Otherwise it was great!



## Any other comments?
